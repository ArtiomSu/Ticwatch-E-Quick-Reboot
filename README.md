# Ticwatch-E-Quick-Reboot

This app allows you to quickly
1. Shutdown the watch
2. Reboot the watch
3. Reboot to recovery
4. Reboot to bootloader

This was made because on wearos the shutdown is hidden deep within the settings.

This app lets you quickly reboot to more advanced modes that would otherwise require adb commands to get into

#### The App uses root access to shutdown and reboot so you must be rooted
